# MasterMind-number

A replica of the MasterMind game. The user must guess a 4-digit code. They are allowed 10 attempts. With each attempt, the application will show him how many numbers are in the right place and how many are in the wrong place, without telling him what number it is. Numbers that do not belong to the code will not be processed.
